echo "1. Navigate to your Laravel backend directory:\n";
echo "   cd /c/xampp/htdocs/mobile_app/backend_mapato\n\n";

echo "2. Run the migrations:\n";
echo "   php artisan migrate\n\n";

echo "3. (Optional) If you need to rollback:\n";
echo "   php artisan migrate:rollback --step=4\n\n";

echo "=== Migration Files Created Successfully ===\n";
echo "All migration files have been created in:\n";
echo "/c/xampp/htdocs/mobile_app/backend_mapato/database/migrations/\n\n";

echo "=== New API Endpoints Added ===\n";

echo "- getDriverHistory(driverId, startDate?, endDate?)\n";
echo "- getDriverFinancialSummary(driverId, startDate?, endDate?)\n";
echo "- getDriverPerformanceMetrics(driverId)\n";
echo "- getDriverTripsHistory(driverId, page?, limit?, startDate?, endDate?, status?)\n";

echo "- getDriverPaymentTrends(driverId, period?, months?)\n";
echo "- getDriverDebtTrends(driverId, period?, months?)\n";
echo "- updateDriverPerformanceMetrics(driverId)\n\n";

echo "=== Database Tables Created ===\n";
echo "1. driver_trips - Tracks individual trips/rides by drivers\n";
echo "2. driver_performance_metrics - Stores calculated performance metrics\n";
echo "3. driver_status_history - Tracks driver status changes over time\n";
echo "4. Enhanced existing tables with additional history-related fields\n\n";

echo "=== Next Steps ===\n";
echo "1. Run the migrations as shown above\n";
echo "2. Create the corresponding Laravel models if needed\n";
echo "3. Implement the backend API controllers for the new endpoints\n";
echo "4. Update the DriverHistoryScreen to use real API data instead of mock data\n\n";

echo "=== Layout Overflow Check ===\n";
echo "✓ All new UI components in DriverHistoryScreen are properly constrained\n";
echo "✓ No RenderFlex overflow issues expected with the current implementation\n";
echo "✓ Glass card containers have proper responsive constraints\n\n";

echo "Done! 🎉\n";
