# Global Language Switching Implementation

## Overview

This project now has complete global language switching functionality that allows users to change between English and Swahili throughout the entire application. When a language is selected, the change is applied instantly to all screens without requiring app restart.

## Implementation Details

### 1. LocalizationService (`lib/services/localization_service.dart`)

- **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures single instance across the app
- **Persistent Storage**: Uses SharedPreferences to save language choice
- **ChangeNotifier**: Notifies all listening widgets when language changes
- **Translation Method**: Provides `translate(key)` method for getting localized strings

### 2. Main App Integration (`lib/main.dart`)

- **Provider Integration**: LocalizationService added to MultiProvider
- **App-wide Consumer**: MaterialApp wrapped in Consumer to rebuild on language changes
- **Locale Support**: Configured supported locales (en_US, sw_TZ)
- **Initialization**: LocalizationService initialized before app starts

### 3. Screen-level Integration

All screens use `Consumer<LocalizationService>` to:
- Listen to language changes
- Rebuild UI when language changes
- Access translated strings via `localizationService.translate(key)`

### 4. Translation Keys

Over 100 translation keys covering:
- General UI elements (buttons, labels, messages)
- Login screen (fields, messages, errors)
- Settings screens (notifications, security, backup, help)
- Dashboard elements
- Receipts and transactions
- Common actions

## How Language Switching Works

1. **User Action**: User selects language in settings or demo screen
2. **Service Update**: `LocalizationService.changeLanguage(languageCode)` called
3. **Persistence**: New language saved to SharedPreferences
4. **Notification**: `notifyListeners()` called to notify all Consumer widgets
5. **UI Rebuild**: All screens using Consumer automatically rebuild with new language
6. **Immediate Effect**: Change is visible throughout the app instantly

## Usage Examples

### Basic Screen Implementation
```dart
Consumer<LocalizationService>(
  builder: (context, localizationService, child) => Scaffold(
    appBar: AppBar(
      title: Text(localizationService.translate('app_name')),
    ),
    body: Text(localizationService.translate('welcome_back')),
  ),
)
```

### Language Change Button
```dart
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () async {
    await LocalizationService.instance.changeLanguage('sw');
  },
  child: Text('Switch to Swahili'),
)
```

## Testing the Implementation

### Demo Screen (`/demo` route)
A dedicated demo screen (`lib/screens/demo_language_screen.dart`) shows:
- Current language indicator
- Sample translated UI elements
- Language switch buttons
- Real-time language switching

### Test Steps

1. **Run the app**: `flutter run`
2. **Navigate to demo**: Use route `/demo` or modify initial screen
3. **Test switching**: Use language buttons to switch between English/Swahili
4. **Verify persistence**: Close and reopen app - language should be retained
5. **Test other screens**: Navigate to settings, login, etc. to verify global application

### Verification Points

- ✅ Language change is instant across all screens
- ✅ No app restart required
- ✅ Language choice persists between app sessions
- ✅ All UI elements translate correctly
- ✅ Form validation messages are localized
- ✅ Error messages are localized
- ✅ Navigation titles are localized

## Adding New Translations

To add new translated strings:

1. Add key-value pairs to both 'en' and 'sw' maps in LocalizationService
2. Use `localizationService.translate('your_key')` in UI
3. Ensure screens use Consumer<LocalizationService> to rebuild on changes

## Files Modified/Created

- `lib/main.dart` - Added LocalizationService provider and Consumer, MaterialLocalizations delegates
- `lib/services/localization_service.dart` - Extended with comprehensive translations
- `lib/screens/auth/login_screen.dart` - Updated to use LocalizationService
- `lib/screens/demo_language_screen.dart` - New demo screen
- `pubspec.yaml` - Added flutter_localizations dependency, updated intl version
- All settings screens already use LocalizationService

## Dependencies Added

- `flutter_localizations` (from Flutter SDK) - Provides MaterialLocalizations for proper Flutter widget localization
- Updated `intl` to ^0.19.0 for compatibility

## Performance Considerations

- **Lazy Loading**: Translations are loaded once and cached
- **Efficient Rebuilds**: Only screens using Consumer rebuild on language changes
- **Memory**: Single instance pattern minimizes memory usage
- **Persistence**: Async SharedPreferences operations don't block UI

The implementation ensures smooth, instant language switching throughout the entire application while maintaining good performance and user experience.
