# Final Corrected Database Analysis

## üîç **Database Table Structure Analysis**

Based on your screenshot and Flutter code analysis, here are the **correct** database table structures:

## ‚úÖ **Corrected SQL Queries**

### **1. Unpaid Debts Count**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM debt_records WHERE is_paid = 0
```
‚úÖ **Status:** Correct

### **2. Active Devices Count**  
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM devices WHERE is_active = 1
```
‚úÖ **Status:** Correct

### **3. Active Drivers Count**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM drivers WHERE is_active = 1
```
‚úÖ **Status:** Correct

### **4. Generated Receipts Count**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM payment_receipts WHERE status = 'generated'
```
‚úÖ **Status:** Correct - Uses `status` column in `payment_receipts` table

### **5. Pending Receipts Count** ‚ö†Ô∏è **CORRECTED**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM payments WHERE receipt_status = 'pending'
```
‚úÖ **Status:** **Now Corrected** - Uses `receipt_status` column in `payments` table

**Previous Error:** I mistakenly assumed `payments` table didn't have `receipt_status` column
**Correction:** Your screenshot clearly shows the `payments` table **does have** `receipt_status` column

### **6. Revenue Calculations** ‚ö†Ô∏è **CORRECTED**

**Daily Revenue:**
```sql
SELECT COALESCE(SUM(total_amount), 0) as revenue
FROM (
    SELECT paid_amount as total_amount 
    FROM debt_records 
    WHERE is_paid = 1 AND DATE(paid_at) = CURDATE()
    UNION ALL
    SELECT amount as total_amount 
    FROM payments 
    WHERE DATE(created_at) = CURDATE()
) as daily_revenue
```

**Weekly Revenue:**
```sql
SELECT COALESCE(SUM(total_amount), 0) as revenue
FROM (
    SELECT paid_amount as total_amount 
    FROM debt_records 
    WHERE is_paid = 1 
      AND WEEK(paid_at, 1) = WEEK(NOW(), 1) 
      AND YEAR(paid_at) = YEAR(NOW())
    UNION ALL
    SELECT amount as total_amount 
    FROM payments 
    WHERE WEEK(created_at, 1) = WEEK(NOW(), 1) 
      AND YEAR(created_at) = YEAR(NOW())
) as weekly_revenue
```

**Monthly Revenue:**
```sql
SELECT COALESCE(SUM(total_amount), 0) as revenue
FROM (
    SELECT paid_amount as total_amount 
    FROM debt_records 
    WHERE is_paid = 1 
      AND MONTH(paid_at) = MONTH(NOW()) 
      AND YEAR(paid_at) = YEAR(NOW())
    UNION ALL
    SELECT amount as total_amount 
    FROM payments 
    WHERE MONTH(created_at) = MONTH(NOW()) 
      AND YEAR(created_at) = YEAR(NOW())
) as monthly_revenue
```

‚úÖ **Status:** **Corrected** - Uses `paid_amount` for `debt_records` table, `amount` for `payments` table

## üìä **Final Database Column Mapping**

### **debt_records Table**
- ‚úÖ `is_paid` - boolean (0 or 1)
- ‚úÖ `paid_amount` - decimal/double (**corrected from `amount`**)
- ‚úÖ `paid_at` - datetime
- ‚úÖ `expected_amount` - decimal/double

### **payments Table**
- ‚úÖ `amount` - decimal/double (correct column name)
- ‚úÖ `receipt_status` - string (**confirmed exists** - 'pending', 'generated', etc.)
- ‚úÖ `created_at` - datetime

### **payment_receipts Table**
- ‚úÖ `status` - string ('generated', 'sent', etc.) 
- ‚úÖ `payment_id` - foreign key to payments table
- ‚úÖ `generated_at` - datetime

### **devices Table**
- ‚úÖ `is_active` - boolean (0 or 1)

### **drivers Table**
- ‚úÖ `is_active` - boolean (0 or 1)

## üéØ **Key Corrections Made**

### **1. Revenue Calculations**
- **Changed:** `debt_records.amount` ‚Üí `debt_records.paid_amount`
- **Reason:** The `debt_records` table uses `paid_amount` column, not `amount`

### **2. Pending Receipts Logic**
- **Changed:** Complex NOT EXISTS query ‚Üí Simple `receipt_status = 'pending'` 
- **Reason:** The `payments` table has `receipt_status` column as confirmed by your screenshot

### **3. Generated Receipts Logic**
- **Confirmed:** Uses `payment_receipts.status = 'generated'` (correct)
- **Reason:** The `payment_receipts` table uses `status` column, not `receipt_status`
