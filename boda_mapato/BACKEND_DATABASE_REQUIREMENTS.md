# Backend Database Requirements - Exact Column Filtering

## ðŸŽ¯ **Updated Dashboard Requirements**

## ðŸš€ **Comprehensive Endpoint (Recommended)**

For optimal performance, implement a single endpoint that returns all data:

**Endpoint**: `GET /api/admin/dashboard/comprehensive`

**SQL Implementation** (All queries combined):
```sql
SELECT 
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM debt_records WHERE is_paid = 0) as unpaid_debts_count,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM devices WHERE is_active = 1) as active_devices_count,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM drivers WHERE is_active = 1) as active_drivers_count,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM payment_receipts WHERE receipt_status = 'generated') as generated_receipts_count,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM payments WHERE receipt_status = 'pending') as pending_receipts_count,
  
  -- Daily Revenue
  (SELECT COALESCE(SUM(total_amount), 0) 
   FROM (
     SELECT amount as total_amount FROM debt_records WHERE is_paid = 1 AND DATE(paid_at) = CURDATE()
     UNION ALL
     SELECT amount as total_amount FROM payments WHERE DATE(created_at) = CURDATE()
   ) as daily_rev) as daily_revenue,
   
  -- Weekly Revenue  
  (SELECT COALESCE(SUM(total_amount), 0) 
   FROM (
     SELECT amount as total_amount FROM debt_records WHERE is_paid = 1 AND WEEK(paid_at) = WEEK(NOW()) AND YEAR(paid_at) = YEAR(NOW())
     UNION ALL
     SELECT amount as total_amount FROM payments WHERE WEEK(created_at) = WEEK(NOW()) AND YEAR(created_at) = YEAR(NOW())
   ) as weekly_rev) as weekly_revenue,
   
  -- Monthly Revenue
  (SELECT COALESCE(SUM(total_amount), 0) 
   FROM (
     SELECT amount as total_amount FROM debt_records WHERE is_paid = 1 AND MONTH(paid_at) = MONTH(NOW()) AND YEAR(paid_at) = YEAR(NOW())
     UNION ALL
     SELECT amount as total_amount FROM payments WHERE MONTH(created_at) = MONTH(NOW()) AND YEAR(created_at) = YEAR(NOW())
   ) as monthly_rev) as monthly_revenue;
```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "unpaid_debts_count": 15,
    "active_devices_count": 12,
    "active_drivers_count": 18,
    "generated_receipts_count": 45,
    "pending_receipts_count": 8,
    "daily_revenue": 15000,
    "weekly_revenue": 85000,
    "monthly_revenue": 240000
  }
}
```

## âœ… **Current Flutter App Status**

The Flutter app has been updated with:
- âœ… **Smart fallback logic** - tries new endpoints first, falls back to existing ones
- âœ… **Client-side filtering** - filters data when backend doesn't have new endpoints
- âœ… **Parallel loading** - all queries run simultaneously for performance
- âœ… **Error resilience** - graceful handling of missing endpoints or data

**The app will work immediately with existing endpoints and get even better performance once new endpoints are implemented!**
